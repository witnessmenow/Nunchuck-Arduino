# Nunchuck Adaptor Hardware

This is a collection of boards and adaptors for connecting to Nintendo Nunchucks with Arduino boards.

The folder contain the gerber files to order these boards. None of them require any components other than headers for operation.

## Ordering the PCBs

Download the gerber file of the board you want and order from your favorite PCB fab. Personally I would usually use JLCPCB or Oshpark (not sponsored!)

Make sure to use a PCB thickness of 1.6mm or higher. I have always used 1.6mm PCBs, and I have never had any complaints, but Adafruit use 2.0mm for theirs.

## Board Project Files

The boards were created using EasyEDA, and the projects can be accessed here:
